I made this website when I was still a recent Computer Science graduate, 
passionate about the intersection of storytelling and technology. 
In particular, innovation in the digital storytelling realm — be it using code, video, 
long-form prose, or mixed-media — is what I was most excited about.

Back then I was looking to use data and software to tell stories aimed at 
exploring novel perspectives and mitigating biases. I also explored how 
storytellers can use choose-your-own-adventure-games as tools to build 
narratives that create positive social impact.

Today I am still a data nerd, albeit in a slightly different context. I 
analyze vast amounts of data to identify real user problems,and figure out 
how to solve them efficiently, as a PM." export default IntroData
